•	Centralized incident tracking and lifecycle management
•	Guided response workflows for SOC teams
•	Real-time administrative dashboard for monitoring threats
•	Audit trail generation and compliance documentation
•	Risk analysis and incident reporting for decision-making
3. User Characteristics
General Employees / Reporters:
Have minimal technical expertise and require a simple, user-friendly interface to report security incidents quickly.
SOC Analysts:
Possess high technical knowledge and cybersecurity expertise. They require detailed incident data, response tools, and workflow guidance.
System Administrator / Security Manager:
Are experienced in system monitoring, compliance management, and report analysis. They oversee system configuration, user roles, and audit reviews.
4. Constraints
•	The system requires a secure and stable internet connection.
•	Must comply with organizational security policies and regulatory standards.
