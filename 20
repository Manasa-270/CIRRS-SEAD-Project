20. CASE Tool Setup
For the design phase of the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting & Response System, a Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool was selected to efficiently create, manage, and maintain system design artifacts.
Selected CASE Tool: StarUML
StarUML was installed and configured on the development environment to support UML-based system modeling. The tool is used to design and document various system diagrams, including:
•	Use Case Diagrams
•	Class Diagrams
•	Sequence Diagrams
•	Activity Diagrams
•	Component Diagrams
•	Deployment Diagrams
Benefits of the CASE Tool
The selected CASE tool provides the following advantages:
•	Support for standard UML notation
•	Clear and consistent visualization of system architecture
•	Ease of modification and maintenance of design diagrams
•	Improved understanding and communication of system structure and behavior
The successful installation and configuration of the CASE tool ensures a structured, systematic, and standardized approach to the design and documentation of the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting & Response System.
