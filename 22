22. Project Structure Creation
The project structure within the CASE tool was designed to logically organize all UML diagrams related to the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting & Response System. The structure ensures clarity, consistency, and ease of maintenance throughout the system design phase.
Project Structure
The following structure was created:
•	Use Case Diagrams
o	Employee / Incident Reporter Use Cases
o	SOC Analyst Use Cases
o	Administrator Use Cases
•	Class Diagrams
o	Core System Classes
o	Supporting and Utility Classes
•	Sequence Diagrams
o	Incident Reporting Flow
o	Severity Classification Flow
o	Incident Response Workflow
o	Notification and Alert Flow
•	Activity Diagrams
o	Incident Reporting Activity Flow
o	SOC Response Workflow
•	Component Diagram
o	System Architecture Components
•	Deployment Diagram
o	System Deployment Environment
This structured organization of UML artifacts ensures a clear understanding of system behaviour, architecture, and interactions, thereby supporting effective design, collaboration, and future enhancements of the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting & Response System.
