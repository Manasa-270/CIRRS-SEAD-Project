25. Use Case Relationships
Use case relationships describe how different use cases within the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting & Response System are connected using «include» and «extend» relationships. These relationships help in modularizing functionality and avoiding redundancy.
Include Relationships
User Authentication is included in:
Report Incident
Initiate Response Workflow
Update Incident Status
Monitor Incident Dashboard
Generate Reports and Audit Logs
(Users must be authenticated before performing any secure system operation.)
Track Incident Status is included in:
Monitor Incident Dashboard
Generate Reports and Audit Logs

Extend Relationships
Send Notification extends:
Report Incident
Update Incident Status
(Notifications are triggered only when specific events such as incident creation or status change occur.)
Classify Incident Severity extends:
Report Incident
(Severity classification occurs after an incident is reported.)

These use case relationships ensure a structured, reusable, and efficient system design, supporting secure and streamlined cybersecurity incident management.
