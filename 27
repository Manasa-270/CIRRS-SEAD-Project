27. Class Identification
Based on the requirements and use cases of the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting & Response System, the following core classes have been identified. These classes collectively model the structure and behavior of the system:
User

Incident
Captures all details related to a cybersecurity event, including description, timestamp, severity, status, and associated evidence.
SeverityLevel
Classifies incidents according to their criticality (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical) to prioritize response workflows.
ResponseWorkflow
Represents structured steps to mitigate or resolve an incident. It can include automated actions, guided procedures, and escalation paths.
Alert
Encapsulates system-generated notifications triggered by new incidents, updates, or status changes, sent to relevant users or teams.
Admin
Represents system administrators responsible for managing users, incidents, dashboards, and compliance settings.
AuditTrail
Records all actions taken on an incident or within the system, including timestamps, user actions, and changes, ensuring accountability and compliance.
Report
Generates analytical insights and summaries for management or compliance purposes, such as incident trends, response efficiency, and risk analysis.
