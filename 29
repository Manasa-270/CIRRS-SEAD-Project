29. Class Relationships
The relationships among classes define how components of the system interact with each other:
A User can report one or more Incidents (Association).
An Incident is classified under one SeverityLevel (Association).
A Response Workflow is linked to one Incident but may include multiple steps (Aggregation).
An Alert is sent to one or more Users (Association).
An Admin manages Users, Response Workflows, and Reports (Association).
An AuditTrail records actions performed by Users or Admins on Incidents (Association).
A Report is generated by an Admin and may include multiple Incidents (Aggregation).
These relationships are represented in the class diagram using association and aggregation relationships, showing how different system components are connected and interact.
