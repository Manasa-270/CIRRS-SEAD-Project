Project Title : Cybersecurity Incident Reporting & Response System (CIRRS)
Problem Description:
In today's digital landscape, organizations face an increasing number of cybersecurity threats, ranging from phishing attacks to sophisticated ransomware. The traditional methods of incident reporting and response are often fragmented, relying on emails, spreadsheets, and manual processes. This leads to:
•	Delays in incident reporting and response
•	Lack of real-time visibility for stakeholders
•	Inefficient coordination among security teams
•	Poor documentation for compliance and audit purposes
•	Increased risk of data breaches and financial losses
Proposed Solution:
The Cybersecurity Incident Reporting & Response System (CIRRS) is a centralized digital platform that streamlines the entire incident management lifecycle. It allows employees to report incidents, classifies incidents based on severity, assigns them to appropriate security personnel, and tracks the response process in real time. The system includes automated workflows, notifications, and comprehensive reporting capabilities.
Target Users:
•	Employees: To report security incidents easily and track their status.
•	Security Analysts: To triage, investigate, and respond to incidents.
•	SOC (Security Operations Center) Team: To manage and monitor security incidents.
•	IT Administrators: To configure and maintain the system.
•	Management: To view reports and dashboards for decision-making.
Value Proposition:
CIRRS provides significant value by reducing the time to detect and respond to security incidents, improving collaboration among security teams, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and enhancing the overall security posture of the organization.
