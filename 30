 Sequence Diagrams Creation
Sequence diagrams represent the chronological interaction between actors and system components for specific system operations. In the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting & Response System, sequence diagrams are used to visualize how users, admins, and system components interact during incident management activities.
The following sequence diagrams are created to capture critical system processes:
Incident Reporting Process
Shows how a User reports a new incident, how it is recorded in the Incident class, classified by SeverityLevel, and notifications are sent via Alert.
Incident Response Workflow Process
Illustrates how a ResponseWorkflow is triggered for a reported incident, steps are executed, and progress is updated for the User and Admin to monitor.
Alert Notification Process
Represents how Alerts are generated and sent to relevant Users or Security Teams based on incident severity or workflow updates.
Admin Report Generation Process
Demonstrates how an Admin accesses the system to generate Reports that summarize incidents, workflow statuses, and compliance information.
These diagrams help developers and stakeholders clearly understand the internal workings of the system, the responsibilities of each component, and the flow of information for efficient incident management.
