Sequence Diagram 1: Token Generation Process
Actors & Modules:
Employee/User – Reports the incident
Incident Reporting System – Receives and processes incidents
Severity Module – Classifies the threat severity
Response Workflow Module – Initiates guided response actions
SOC Dashboard – Displays incident status to security teams
Interaction Flow:
Employee/User logs an incident.
Incident Reporting System validates incident details.
Severity Module classifies the severity (low, medium, high).
Response Workflow Module triggers the appropriate mitigation workflow.
SOC Dashboard updates in real-time with incident status and resolution steps.
Audit & Compliance Module logs all actions for accountability.
This ensures incidents are logged, classified, mitigated, and tracked in a structured, transparent, and auditable manner.


Sequence Diagram 2: Calling and Serving the Next Customer

Detailed Interaction Flow: 
The employee logs into the system using secure authentication to access the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting & Response Platform.
The employee selects the option to report a new cybersecurity incident and submits relevant details such as incident type, description, and affected assets.
The system validates the incident submission and automatically logs the report into the centralized digital command center.
The Automatic Severity Classification module analyzes the incident and determines its severity level based on predefined threat assessment rules.
The classified incident is assigned to the Security Operations Center (SOC) team for investigation and mitigation.
The system updates the incident status in real time, notifies relevant security personnel, and records all actions in the audit trail for compliance purposes.
This sequence ensures rapid incident detection, accurate severity classification, coordinated response actions, and transparent monitoring, enabling efficient threat mitigation and regulatory compliance.
Sequence Diagram 3: Customer Notification Proces
Detailed Interaction Flow: Incident Status Notification Process
The system continuously monitors the status of reported cybersecurity incidents within the centralized incident management platform.
When a significant status change occurs (such as severity escalation, mitigation start, or resolution), the system triggers a notification event.
The Notification Service prepares and dispatches alert messages to relevant stakeholders, including employees, SOC team members, and administrators.
The recipients receive real-time notifications informing them about incident progress, required actions, or resolution updates.
This process ensures timely awareness, improved coordination, and proactive response, reducing delays in threat mitigation and enhancing overall security operations efficiency.

Sequence Diagram 4: Administrative Queue Monitoring Process
Detailed Interaction Flow:
The administrator logs into the system using secure administrative credentials to access privileged monitoring functions.
The administrator accesses the real-time incident monitoring dashboard within the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting & Response System.
The system aggregates live incident data, including incident counts, severity levels, response status, and active mitigation efforts.
The Reporting and Analytics Module generates performance and compliance reports, highlighting response times, resolution efficiency, and risk trends.
The administrator reviews the dashboard and reports to identify delays, bottlenecks, resource constraints, or recurring threat patterns.
This sequence enables data-driven decision-making, efficient resource allocation, proactive threat management, and compliance oversight, strengthening overall organizational security posture.
