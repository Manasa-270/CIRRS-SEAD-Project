34. Workflow Documentation
Workflow documentation explains complex system processes using clear steps, decision points, and parallel activities. It helps in understanding how different components of the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting & Response System work together in real-world security scenarios.
Workflow 1: End-to-End Cybersecurity Incident Response Workflow
An employee detects a potential cybersecurity incident such as phishing, malware, or unauthorized access.
The employee logs into the system securely and submits an incident report with relevant details.
The system validates the submission and records the incident in the centralized command center.
The Automatic Severity Classification Module analyzes the incident and assigns a severity level.
The incident is added to the active incident queue for tracking and response.
The system notifies the Security Operations Center (SOC) about the newly reported incident.
SOC analysts investigate the incident and initiate appropriate mitigation actions.
Incident status is continuously updated as response actions progress.
The incident is resolved and verified by the security team.
The incident is closed, and all actions are recorded in the audit trail for compliance and future analysis.
This workflow ensures rapid detection, structured response, real-time visibility, and regulatory compliance, minimizing the impact of cybersecurity threats.
Workflow 2: Security Operations Center (SOC) Incident Handling Workflow
SOC analyst logs into the system using privileged credentials.
The analyst views the active incident queue along with severity levels and priority indicators.
The analyst selects the highest-priority incident based on risk and impact.
The system retrieves incident details and historical context.
The analyst performs investigation and containment actions.
Mitigation steps are executed following guided response workflows.
Incident status is updated in real time within the system.
Once resolved, the incident is marked as closed, and post-incident documentation is completed.
This workflow improves response efficiency, prioritization accuracy, collaboration, and accountability within security teams.
