37. Design Document Creation
The design document explains the architectural and design decisions made during the development of the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting & Response System. The system is designed using a modular and layered approach to improve maintainability, clarity, and scalability.
Design Decisions
· A modular architecture is used to separate incident reporting, severity classification, response workflow management, notification, and audit tracking.
· UML diagrams are used to visually represent system structure (class diagrams) and behavior (sequence and activity diagrams).
· Security is handled through role-based authentication for employees, SOC analysts, and administrators.
· The database is centralized to maintain data consistency, integrity, and compliance.
Assumptions
· The system is deployed within the organization’s network infrastructure.
· Users have basic digital literacy.
· Internet or local network connectivity is available during working hours.
Limitations
· The system does not directly block or remove cyber threats; it only supports reporting and response.
· Advanced AI-based threat prediction is not included.
· Integration with external SOC tools or third-party security platforms is not supported in this version.
Scalability Considerations
· The system can be extended to support multiple offices or SOC teams.
· Additional incident types or reporting modules can be added easily.
· Notification methods can be expanded to include SMS, email, or real-time dashboard alerts.
This design ensures that the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting & Response System meets functional requirements while remaining robust, secure, and suitable for academic implementation.
